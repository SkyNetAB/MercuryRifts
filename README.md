###Compiling
Compiling EnhancedPortals is the same as compiling any other mod that uses ForgeGradle.

1. Clone EnhancedPortals into any directory.
2. Open up a command line and navigate to that directory.
3. Execute `gradlew build`.
4. If `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` appears, you'll find the `EnhancedPortals-{mcversion}-{version}.jar` in `build\libs\`.
