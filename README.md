**Latest Beta**: [1.0 Beta 1](http://goo.gl/6pg5T).

* All currently released aspects of this mod need extensive testing, as the entire mod has been rewritten from scratch.

###Setting up the development environment
The build scripts are set up in the exact same way as the Equivalent Exchange 3 scripts.

When setting up your development environment, follow the guide in [Equivalent Exchange 3's readme file](https://github.com/pahimar/Equivalent-Exchange-3/blob/master/README.md), but obviously replace ee3 with enhanced-portals.
When done, your directory structure should look like this:

***
	development
	\mcp
		\forge\
		\jars\
		\mcp files
	\source
		\enhanced-portals\
			\common\
			\resources\
			\README.md
			\other files
		\computercraft-api\
			\*
		\thermalexpansion-api\
			\*
