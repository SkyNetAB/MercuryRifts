##EnhancedPortals 2
[Minecraft Forums Thread](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1301217-)

**Latest Beta**: [1.0 Beta 2b](http://goo.gl/ZEXe5)

**Release Notes**: [Changelog](https://github.com/ShadedDimension/enhanced-portals/blob/development/CHANGELOG.md#beta-2b)

###Setting up the development environment
The build scripts are set up in the exact same way as the Equivalent Exchange 3 scripts.

When setting up your development environment, follow the guide in [Equivalent Exchange 3's readme file](https://github.com/pahimar/Equivalent-Exchange-3/blob/master/README.md), but obviously replace ee3 with enhanced-portals.
When done, your directory structure should look like this. (Add the computercraft API into the directory listed)
