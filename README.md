##Enhanced Portals
**Latest Release**: [2.0.3 for Minecraft 1.5 | 2.0.2-Quickfix for Minecraft 1.4.7](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1301217-)

[Minecraft Forums Thread](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1301217-)

###Setting up the development environment
The build scripts are set up in the exact same way as the Equivalent Exchange 3 scripts.

When setting up your development environment, follow the guide in [Equivalent Exchange 3's readme file](https://github.com/pahimar/Equivalent-Exchange-3/blob/master/README.md), but obviously replace ee3 with enhanced-portals.
When done, your directory structure should look like this:

***
	development
	\mcp
		\forge\
		\jars\
		\mcp files
	\source
		\enhanced-portals\
			\common\
			\resources\
			\README.md
			\other files
***

###Translation
Currently I am in need of people that can translate Enhanced Portals into many different languages. If you are fluent in another language, feel free to head over to the [lang directory](/tree/master/resources/mods/enhancedportals/lang), see what needs to be done and copy and edit the en_US.xml file.
