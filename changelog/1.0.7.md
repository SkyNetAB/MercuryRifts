###1.0.7
* Updated to 1.6.2.
* Some GUIs have been rewritten to take advantage of new features.
 * Tabs for Redstone Control.
 * Upgrades now get removed when you click, instead of all being removed at once when you closed the GUI.
 * Minor tweaks and improvements.
* Support for the new Fluid system in Forge.
 * Modifiers using the old Liquid system will be incompatible, you must re-add any liquid textures you want applied to a portal.
* Updated Teleporter to look for both Vanilla portal blocks and EP2 portal blocks. Should hopefully resolve any issues remaining with the current system.
